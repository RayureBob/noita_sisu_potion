# noita_sisu_potion
This mods adds a new material that, when ingested, gives a status effect healing the player but with a counter part.

Noita is a very hard game and I like it that way. However I asked myself if I could add something like a healing potion, without going against the devs' intentions.
This is my attemps :)

As of today, I have a material and a custom game effect. The next step is to add a new behavior to the player entity. I'm close but not quite there yet.
