# Noita - Liquid sisu potion
###Still WIP
This mods adds a new material that, when ingested, gives a status effect healing the player but with the counter part that the player will take twice as much damage for the following 5 minutes.


Noita is a very hard game and I like it that way. However I asked myself if I could add something like a healing potion, without going against the devs' intentions.
This is my attemps :)

As of today, I have a material and a custom game effect. The next step is to add a new behavior to the player entity. I'm close but not quite there yet.

Noita is a finnish game. The game is fully translated in a fine english, except for the name of the creatures we find in the world. I decided to abide to this rule, out of respect for the designers, and went with the word "Liquid Sisu" as the name of the new material.

### Gird your loins

Sisu is a finnish word that doesn't translate to english. It is a word that describes a finnish philosophy, central in the way they live their lifes. It's having guts, having grit, being brave, surspassing themself... And Finland proved itself to be capable of outstanding things during the last century. ([the winter war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War)).

[This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9667267/) show that Sisu can be either beneficial or harmful. Without getting into the details of it, I found that the idea of a Liquid Sisu would perfectly fit to this mod.

On one hand, it heals efficiently. On the other, it makes you more vulnerable. It's a very basic risk/reward implementation, and I'd love the mod to be deeper than that, but it's a good starting point for now.

*The girl pulled her blanket up to her nose, her eyes riveted to the strange shadows dancing around her window. A chaotic spectacle which yet managed to convey some sort of intent. Slim sticks of shade were crawling on the walls, the ground, the ceiling. Sometimes entering uninvited, sometimes feinting going out, as of to tease the terrified child. The shadows were not alone, as they never really are. The great moon was close behind, lighting up what should and veiling up the rest, and with her was the wind, which made darkness whistle. So the girl, set in her bed like she would be in a coffin, was waiting silently for her fate to come.*

*But feeling terror settle, he mother came instead. She sat close to her daughter and pulled the blanket down. She caressed her little girl, looked into her eyes, spoke to her four words and then a few goodbyes, and gave back to the night its place by the child's side.*

*The girl then fell sound asleep. She now had a spell. She was Noita. Shadows should be afraid, if ever fear was to be felt.*

*"Sisu, minun pikku noitani."*
